    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Danny Lin, a passionate developer and AI enthusiast with a deep curiosity for exploring the
frontiers of technology. I love creating interactive applications, learning new programming languages, frameworks,
and tools, and sharing knowledge through projects that challenge me to innovate. Over the years, I have developed a
strong foundation in software development, game design, and AI, which has allowed me to experiment with a variety of
creative projects. My interests lie at the intersection of technology, creativity, and problem-solving, where I can
build applications that are both functional and engaging.
</p>
<p>Throughout my academic and personal journey, I have gained experience working with languages and platforms such as C++,
Python, Qt, Unreal Engine, and Pygame. I enjoy not only coding but also designing the user experience and thinking about how
software can have a meaningful impact. I am constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skillset, whether it is through
building new games, experimenting with AI models, or learning about cybersecurity and networking protocols. These experiences
have strengthened my ability to analyze complex problems, develop efficient solutions, and think critically about software
architecture.</p>

<h2>My 2025-2026 Software Engineer Goals:</h2>
<ul class="list1">
  <li>Deep dive into the world of cybersecurity with hands-on projects, including building firewalls, network monitoring tools,
  and TCP validation mechanisms to understand real-world security challenges.</li>
  <li>Explore the world of Machine Learning and AI by developing innovative projects such as building a chess AI bot,
  experimenting with generative models, and creating a GPT-style language model from scratch.</li>
  <li>Brainstorm and develop my own commercial projects, ranging from mobile games to productivity applications, aiming to
  combine creativity with practical usability and potentially bring these ideas to market.</li>
</ul>

<p>My long-term vision is to build impactful software that combines functionality, creativity, and technical excellence. 
  I aim to create projects that not only solve problems but also inspire curiosity and innovation in others. I welcome collaboration,
  feedback, and discussions with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.
